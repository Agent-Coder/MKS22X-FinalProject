# MKS22X-FinalProject: BERRY CONQUEST
  Welcome to our final project! We've developed a game based off *[Bad Ice Cream](https://www.crazygames.com/game/bad-ice-cream)*, but with an unique twist: we've added Pokémon to it! This project was created by [Amanda Zheng](https://github.com/Agent-Coder) and [Justin Chen](https://github.com/jcmmii) over the span of a bit over two weeks, so it while it won't contain as many features as the original game, we hope that the game is still enjoyable nonetheless. 

-------

## Project Description:
The player chooses one of the three Pokémon to play as: Manaphy, Empoleon, or Glaceon. The objective is to go through each level and attempt to get all the berries without being attacked by various enemy Pokémon. If an enemy comes in contact with the player, the player will have to restart the level. Players will have to navigate through not only enemies but obstacles scattered throughout each level. Players will also have the ability to create ice blocks as obstacles for enemies. However, those ice blocks can become obstacles for the players themselves. The player beats the game once they've completed all 5 levels.
